title: History and high-level project description
layout: post

When I thought about how to try in practice all technologies I studied last years - I just decided to create project which could include all my interests:

* a lot of data,
* distributed/cluster programming,
* ML,
* mobile device programming,
* reactive/functional programming,
* network/REST programming,
* DevOps and so on....

The idea of implementing a news aggregator (with a client on Android) and its server side for data collection, processing, storage and presentation was chosen.
It could give me a chance to use all technologies I wanted.

From high-level point of view project could be drawn like this:

![Project Inrastructure Schema]({{ "/assets/img/schema-intro.png" | relative_url }})

Project divided in many parts (one for each component and other things) - which are available in my repos with prefix "story_line2_".

*TOC:*

* [next subsections TBD]()
